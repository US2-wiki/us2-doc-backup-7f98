Components are the primary source of progression in Upload Simulator 2.

Components can be either purchased or upgraded. Purchasing components will add to the component count, scaling its rewarding attribute linearly. Upgrading will add to the component level, scaling its attributes exponentially, but causing the component count to reset back to 1.
Each component has its price and rewarding attributes defined by different formulas and values, although the [[GPU]] and [[network]] components scale very similarly.

You start the game with a single [[GPU]] component. Allowing you to mine your first [[credits]] and purchase a [[network]] component to start uploading.
