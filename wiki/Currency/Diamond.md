Diamonds are a premium currency which can be obtained in multiple ways:
- [[Particle Accelerator]]
	- You can gain 100 diamonds per [[Particle Accelerator]] every second. This is passive generation and is limited by diamond capacity.
	- [[PC]]:
		- Diamond capacity is determined by the number of `Expand` Upgrades you have on the [[Shop]] page. 
		![[example_expand.png]]
	- [[Mobile]]:
		- Diamond capacity is directly related to the number of Particle accelerators you have. This is calculated by equation by:
			  $1000000\times(1+PA)$
			  $PA$ = Number of [[Particle Accelerator|Particle Accelerators]]
